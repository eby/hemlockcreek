# Small Farm Conference 2014

### Using Technology for Production & Conservation

* 140 year old farm
* 330 acre - 20 acres in production
* greenhouses and hoop houses
* raised beds and plastic mulch
* why? season extension, reduced labor, quality, conservation
* 5 ton heat pump. 30-40k investment
* geothermal cooling for walk in cooler. reversed in winter to heat greenhouse. 
* larger blower since fluid is less chilled
* fluid around 28 and cooler set for mid 30s
* also using it to chill potable water for field / processing chilling
* lateral field. 5 150' trenches, 4' wide, 7' deep. 4 tubes per trench. 2 per layer
* cooling display table
* $6/day conventional cooler. $1/day geothermal
* water storage tank for heat storage and irrigation for greenhouse. roof rainoff goes into it. 12k gal
* in reverse can do 120F fluid
* VFD (variable frequency drives) on pumps change power based on load
* went solar and tied in for net metering
* 24' tunnels. high gothic. rail movable. never have had to shovel. all bolts no tek screws
