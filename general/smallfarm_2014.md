### Using Technology for Production & Conservation

* http://coveyouscenicfarm.com/
* 140 year old farm
* 330 acre - 20 acres in production
* greenhouses and hoop houses
* raised beds and plastic mulch
* why? season extension, reduced labor, quality, conservation
* 5 ton heat pump. 30-40k investment
* geothermal cooling for walk in cooler. reversed in winter to heat greenhouse. 
* larger blower since fluid is less chilled
* fluid around 28 and cooler set for mid 30s
* also using it to chill potable water for field / processing chilling
* lateral field. 5 150' trenches, 4' wide, 7' deep. 4 tubes per trench. 2 per layer
* cooling display table
* $6/day conventional cooler. $1/day geothermal
* water storage tank for heat storage and irrigation for greenhouse. roof rainoff goes into it. 12k gal
* in reverse can do 120F fluid
* VFD (variable frequency drives) on pumps change power based on load. money savings
* went solar and tied in for net metering
* 24' tunnels. high gothic. rail movable. never have had to shovel. all bolts no tek screws
* pulled with 14' spade

### Keynote

* text of talk: http://mismallfarmconf.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/john-ikerd-small-farms-are-real-farms.pdf
* small farms are (the only) real farms
* http://www.johnikerd.com/johnikerd.com/Home.html
* Food system revolution is happening. Currently peaceful. May remain peaceful may not depending on how bad system gets
* Canâ€™t predict the future but you can often tell when you are approaching the top/fall.
* Farms will become smaller as nature and society demands it
* Sustainability will take a different world view
* Organics subverted by standardization and drive for profit
* Specialization and standardization is end of sustainability.

### Post Harvest Handling
* fresh produce is alive
* as soon as cut plant begins to deteriorates
* higher temp = quicker deterioration
* every increase by 18F = 2-3x decay
* respiration rate determines cooling need
* pick colder part of day. Move to cooler often
* seen and not heard. If you hear produce hitting harvest bins prob bruised
* out of field quick and in cooler quick
* pick it clean and keep it clean
* living mulch can help keep mud down in rows and keep cool. Kale with alfalfa or rye
* produce should be clean at market. No excuses and doesn't mean washing. 
* potable water at harvest in all cases. Think ahead and plan. Water infiltrated. 
* spray wash don't immerse dirty produce for washing
* water temp. If > 10 deg cooler than larger intake of water/pathogen. Do first wash at near temp. More depth also increases. 
* tsunami and sanidate are both no rinse and no pH control. But not killing agent for all so don't reuse as irrigation. Chico wash is reusable water but pH controlled. 
* spray wash can be hose with nozzle
* visual look at farm for risks on setup
* wash. Rinse. Sanitize. Record
* keep labeled or colored brushes and cleaning equip to keep seperate
* check on chill sensitive produce. Temp is final temp so fine to be in cold cooler if take out before
* cool to core. Many will check temp and reject
* coolbot for air conditioning conversion
* cover boxes with plastic to form tunnel and use fan to pull air through
* cool and ship
* some can be cooled by ice
* storage - humidity and ethylene
* ethylenecontrol.com and peakfresh
* roof, potable, toilet, sanitize, safe food contact 
* design shed dirty to clean linear and not crossed paths. 
* start with what you can and improve

### Food Forestry

(had work issue so missed some of presentation)
* http://rootstofruits.biz/
* Whole system design. Ecologically based
* Stories/Levels - tall, medium, shrub, cover
* Flowering calendar - ensure food for beneficials all season
* Lots of options out there for edible varieties. Think uncommon and multiple uses.
* Easy for homestead sizing. Farm size needs plenty of planning.
* Observe and adapt. No one right way.
* Silvopasture - next step. integrating animals
* wood chip mulch builds soil. innoculate w/ fungus to increase use
