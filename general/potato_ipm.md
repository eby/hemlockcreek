* P-day : degree day based on multiple temperature accumulations

### Early Season
* seed fungicides tend to have 12 day max efficiency
* properly warm up / cut / cure seed
* do not plant into cool/wet soil
* fumigation

### Mid-season
* limit periods of leaf wetness
* manage insect vectors
* preventative sprays / Pday and Blitecast models

### Late season
* limit periods of leaf wetness
* eradicate late blight areas
* kill/harvest early
* lower vine still host for late blight even with top dead

### Post harvest
* limit drop distance
* harvest in moderate temps
* storage applications (ozone, fogs, etc)

### Disease

* Fungicide resistance exists. frac.info site and labels should have code signifying resistance and helps with alternating
* Early Blight - debris bourne fungus, circular leaf lesion usually vein bound, prevalent w/ low nitrogen or pest stress. sporulation 41-86F, dispersed wind/rain. Can be cyclic so multiple infection cycles. Can be lower in canopy. Provide adequate nitrogen, some cultivar resistance. P-day 300 or prior to row touch applications.
* Brown spot - smaller/darker lesion in middle/top canopy, causes black pit on tuber occasionally. can be at same time of early blight but can be later. Related so similar sprays as early.
