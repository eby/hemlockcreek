#Crop Planning for Organic Vegetable Growers

## financial goals
* avg $18/hr/person gross on top veg farms in Quebec 
* planned income - wage = budget
* start with sales and move backwards to budget
## marketing
* farm market / stand - harvest and wait
* restaurant / store - list and pick
* csa - set list and harvest
* decide mix of market based on gross target
* decide crop mix based on equip/knowledge/want. decide sale on kg/piece/bunch
* choose price for each. adapt to reflect profitability
* csa - decide length, weekly worth, set price
### sales projection
* do sheet per market
* list crops for season and prices
* list weeks at market. use same day so sheets easily combined.
* set projected amount able to sell each week
* work harvest target based on all sheets
## field plant schedules
* convert harvest target to plant date and bed length
* set first possible date, revise target if not possible (frost, temp, etc)
* take into account succession, temperamental (bolting), yield
* field safety factor - multiplication for row length to ensure target. 1.3 to start
* calculate bed length per harvest week, per planting
## crop map
* map based on succession and length to maximize space use
* take into account field and harvest dates to make harvest and cover cropping easier
* fertility (heavy feeder, handles over/under fertility) and pest management
* field blocks - unit of crop rotation
* adjust targets if too many blocks required or tweak harvest to maximize profit to area. prep more land
* work on rotation. 3,4,6 yr. alternate heavy/light feeders. early together to allow cover, late together to allow cover, alternate early/late, consider left behind seed pressure
## choosing varieties
* date to maturity - check transplant vs seed, region tested, target replanting window
* trials - small qty, next to non-trial for comparison, avoid edges/variable area, scale up over years
* finalize planting schedule based off varieties picked
## greenhouse schedule
* work backwards from field planting date to determine number of trays / seeds
* greenhouse safety factor. start with 1.3 or for tiny seeds go for 2
* make schedule
## order seeds
* determine amount and 1.3 safety factor. 1.1 for large/costly (tomato, etc)
* convert to weight
## operations calendar
* ground prep - first tillage (deep), second etc tillage (surface breakup)
* stale seed bed - let weeds germinate and then till top 1" or burn/flame. not deep to prevent stirring up more seeds
* fertility - compost, manure (immediate cover crop), cover crop
## carry out
* consult plan weekly and create todo list
* post map
* keep records. before season decide what to keep, design forms,
* seeding, planting, maps, harvest, sales, pests, fertilization, soil prep, variety
* compare season with projections
* adapt - poor germination, bad seedbed, weather, failure
## analyze profitability
* in space - profit vs space required
* intensive - <20 acres shoot for 12k-40k per acre
* calculate yields and compare w/ targets
* in time - profit vs time required (harvest, growth, process, package)
* calculate hourly rate
* shoot for $40-60/hr. streamlined can be 70-100
* compare with targets
* donâ€™t drop immediately. could be failure/mgmt vs variety. multiple years will tell
* compare space and time
* review prices
## plan for next year
* review goals, plan, schedule, maps, varieties, carry out
