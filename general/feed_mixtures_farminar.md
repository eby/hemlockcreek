* alfalfa pasture a good protein source and digestive aid. try to have source of that in summer/free-range
* prefer to use 2-3 protein sources to keep balance of amino acids/minerals
* alfalfa, soy meal and ground peas/canola
* oats good source of lysine
* past 1/3 of ration oats can add too much fiber for younger animals. oat grouts better
* barley a good partial replacement for corn. some say adds a nutty flavor to meat
* canola becoming mostly GM
* liquid whey not good as they fill up. limit it. but: “2/3 maize, 1/3 oats, soak in whey for 3 days; makes great pig feed according to the pigs.”
* chicory & comfry is feed source / dewormer. can grow in fence line
