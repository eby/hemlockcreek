# Integrated Pest Management Academy

Feb 18-29 2014 Okemos, MI

## Intro

* appropriate & economical strategies to manage pests
* science-based decision making process
* pyramid: education, natural control, monitoring/scouting, biopesticides/disrupters, incesticides
* not just ag. recreation env and residential
* multiple factors impacting implementation: product changes, consumer demand, resistance, climate change
* identification is critical to successful IPM program
* monitoring involves both numbers and damage levels
* economic injury level
* monitoring via traps and degree days. disease predictive models
* determine your management goal and thresholds. processors might set for you
* choosing varieties for early harvest or late planting to avoid pest buildup

## IPM strategies for plant disease control

* disease is any malfunctioning of cells or tissues that results from continuous irritation (otherwise an injury)
* can prevent growth or eliminate/reduce presence of plant
* disease life cycle might force production practices (crop rotation, long delay in replanting)
* regulatory might come in (ex: emerald ash borer and wood movement, virus in root stock)
* pathogens (microbes), abiotic (air pollution damage)
* fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, viruses, nematodes
* symptoms and signs (visible pathogen)
* disease triangle: pathogen - host - environment. time also a factor.
* know disease cycle for control options. many can survive for years dormant
* scout scout scout
* msu diagnostic services available. send quality sample (pestid.msu.edu)
* management: monitoring, protection (controls), pathogen eradication, genetic resistance, avoidance, exclusion

## Managing interactions of insects and other pests

* aphids transmit majority of plant viruses
* non-persistent (quick transmission, doesn't get into insect, surface) - needs immediate action
* persistent (moves inside vector, replenished from host) - need to stop generations / movement
* persistent propagative (replicates inside insect)
* midwest vegetable production guide
* most insect herbivores are not vectors of pathogens. damage can lead to other issues
* weeds can be host to issues. can also create environment or climate for pests
* preventative measures are key. sanitation/quarantine, resistance, vectors

## Pollinators

* money out there to help pollinators
* decline in honey bee colonies
* 20k species of bees in world. 400+ in michigan
* lots of diff habitats for keeping on farm. find unused areas (ditches, etc)
* match for timing to keep pollinators around
* nativeplants.msu.edu
* limit sprays during bloom
* check toxicity to bees (LD50)
* pesticide label change to include info on pollinator and restrictions
* integrated crop pollination MSU project at projecticp.org

## Weed Management

* yield loss
* pest habitat (mice, etc)
* >60% of pesticides is herbicides
* prevention better than treatment
* one year of seed can be years and years of weeding
* mechanical weeders - can help but can also mix up seed bank. cultivation can be comparable to burn down herbicides but not pre-emergent
* seed predation - polyculture (red clover, etc) can help
* organic herbicides - citric acid, etc. Expensive and not very effective
* prevention is critical

## Intro to Pesticides

* everything is a poison. just dosage
* classes of insecticides has increased over last 10 years
* different modes of activity (repel vs lethal vs mating disruption, etc)
* once you know mode of activity and what it works on you can time the applications correctly to match life cycle
* data available for rotations to prevent resistance buildup

## Fungicides

* early days was copper (downy mildew), etc
* protectant vs systemic
* resistance is rare but can happen
* biocontrol available. parasitic soil fungi
* specific systemics tend to be less toxic and more effective
* fungicides can be washed off by rain and many are UV sensitive
* protectants - sunny / dry. want quick dry
* systemic - cloudy, moist soil, hydrated plant
* cdms.net for safety sheets

## MSU Resources

* enviroweather.msu.edu
* extension

## Invasive Impacts

* decrease biodiversity, threaten natives. second leading cause of animal population decline
* 50k invasives
* 99% of all crops/livestock are intentional introductions
* during last 60 years introduction as doubled
* short generation time means often spraying and moving away from IPM

## round table

* cover crops great for nematode and other control. stopped spraying for nematode and decreased fertilizer use. oilseed radish
* saves money
* scout
* rotations
* diversity can make it difficult
