* start prep early to wipe out current load. 1+ years good
* practice sanitation. donâ€™t bring some in
* multiple types. heated/unheated. 
* movable taking off. worth it just for rotation and salt, etc
* plastic mulch / bare ground / raised beds
* recommend high side tunnel for better ventilation control and area for working
* row covers for greens. thermal blanket for tomatoes, etc
* fertigation units
* not putting heat and the like in helps make it non-permanent structure for taxes
* incline is best avoided. slight allowable if good drainage tile around it to prevent run in
* control perimeter for weeds and other pathogen vectors
* drip irrigation important so leaves are dry. fungal prevention
* keep humidity low
* spacing and pruning important to keep up airflow
* perpendicular to sides can help with air movement
* no rain - thrips and mites, but passive ventilation so external pests. not the same as field or greenhosue
* straw mulch can keep dust down which also prevents spider mites
* pruning high can help with insect problems. many go for bottom first. lower leaves of tomatos, etc. up to lowest hanging fruit, etc
* beneficials: scout often, know ordering delay, delay in effect
* grafting can help with vigor which can help fight off pests like mites
