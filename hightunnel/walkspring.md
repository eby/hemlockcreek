# Walking into Spring

* harvesting sunshine
* zone 6b
* do math on production area based on what you plan and order accordingly
* east-west orientation
* site: level, good drainage, water, electric. close to packing so no freezing in between
* swales along back and sides to divert water
* use rocks w/rope tied around poly to help throw over and pull. careful not to catch. use brooms to push up
* install blower near the end (second bow or so) so outside air can be vented to it to prevent condensation. dryer vent kit for outside cover
* 3-4-3 twice a year, compost, kelp meal (1lb/ft^2)
* close and open is crucial especially in the edges of winter. tomatoes longer to prevent sphinx moth/hornworm
* watering may be weekly or more depending on sunlight. look for nights that are  >24F (where tunnel remains above freezing) for a few nights. less water less freeze damage (anecdotal)
* heated hobby greenhouse is used to grow transplants for the tunnel
* use T-tape drip for planting. run before to loosen soil and show you bed locations
* lettuce every 12" (emitter). tomatoes every other w/ lettuce in between
* scout often for pests, especially in fall/spring
* aphids - spot spray, grasshoppers there is disease control, mice traps
* know which fungal issues farm already has and plant resistant varieties
* keep items in shade after picking. outside or inside depending on temperature. arugula in water until packed for order to prevent wilting
* good salad spinner is worthwhile for washing for time savings and keeping things fresh
* plans beds on what you want to market and how much. plan accordingly
* how long for transplant / seeding to harvest
* fall/winter - arugula (reseed 3-4 weeks), beets, bunching onions ( oct to sell by jan), onion transplants for march, carrots, chinese cabbage, endive, herbs (chives, cilantro, dill, parsley, oregano, marjoram, thyme), kale, lettuce, mustard, radishes, spinach, tat soi, turnips.
* summer - bell peppers and cucumbers (april transplant)
