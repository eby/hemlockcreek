### Orchard Design
* Youngquist orchards lost 30-70% of some blocks with shear wind. Replanted portions of it. Should have scrapped it and started over to get higher density. 
* If block is older and lower density choose to scrap and go for 10-11ft spacing. No wider than 12ft for fruiting wall type designs.
* Honeycrisp does well with fruiting wall and colors up well.
* Choose rootstock well for soil type. May mean splitting up blocks.
* Get soil where you want it before planting. Some things won't get better without the tilling involved you can do beforehand. 
* Ridgeview dealing with 50% packout due to bitter pit and other issues related to rootstock (118).
* Root pruning and girdling. During bloom for some. Sandy soils it is difficult getting deep enough to do enough damage. Many saw what they thought were improvements but after two years it was gone requiring biannual maintenance. You may not be able to fix bad choice.
* Adding more stress to counteract vigor ends up causing other problems you have to deal with or the bitter pit you were trying to suppress.
* Sandy soils can help with color as well
* For Bud9/Nic29 some found cutting back all second leaf feathers to 3in stubs really flattened out the regrowth. Didn't need to tie anything down.
* Don't fruit first two years. Leave just enough on third to pull branches down.

### Nutrient Program
* N only first few years to push growth. Watch for fireblight when pushing.
* 20-30 first, 40-70 second/third, 100-150 forth N/acre. Then taper off. For clay will need fewer sprays in spacing.
* Summer NAA application for return bloom. June till July 15.
* Phosphorus: Major player in health and color. Should be 16-20 on fruit analysis. Too little can also lead to bitter pit. Too high phosphorus can cause plant to block it. Always compare leaf test vs soil test as you might need to bring it down instead. Phosphates work better in fertigation vs ground application.
* Magnesium: Too high and will cause loam to act like clay. Gypsum in spring can help. Read results carefully. High Mg will cause the plant to block it. Leaf tests saying Mg deficiency might actually be too much in soil. 
* K/Mg ration can be as important as pH
* Foliar feeding: know what you are buying as many things won't help you unless at the exact time they will be taken up. Some tests should look bad. If plant is working well you should be seeing things burning up. Compare with soil and what symptoms you are seeing. If looks healthy you might just be helping your tests and not the plant. Important to check "point of deliquescence" on the MSDS sheet. This is the humidity / temperature point at which the salt becomes soluble on the surface. Wasn't able to actually find this on any MSDS or labels I checked so need to find out more info on what to look for. The company he works for also pushes a bunch of foliar sprays so may be difference between divisions.
* Zinc: low zinc and calcium doesn't distribute to where it needs to go
* Cover crops: Know your crop. Brassicas kill microrhysi and other organisms that help tree and soil health.

#### Calcium
* Terminals draw calcium out of fruit. Balancing act of calcium management and return bloom.
* Bud9 - 150 calcium nitrate split to be every couple weeks for first few years
* Gypsum under drip line in spring can be as good as five sprays. Post harvest application is also good.
* Calcium should be applied just prior to golf balls stage. Other time is 3-4 weeks before harvest. This are the two times there is the cell division where the fruit itself will uptake the calcium.
* Calcium nitrate is usually overkill and gives you too much N which you will have to counteract. Better for earlier years when you want the N. If you do go for this then get it premixed with buffers. Easy to burn.
* Apogee slows the calcium draw from fruit to terminals. This can be as good or even better than a calcium spray.
* Too much calcium will affect Mg & K uptake and mess with storage, taste and other issues.

### Storage
* 38F is threshold for cold injury
* 3% co2 is toxic for honey crisp
* Holding at higher temperature before storage reduces storage injury. 
* Temperature and time ranges from 50-70F for 2-7days depending on preference. Some processors preferred 70F for a few days so could move quickly with product coming in. SmartFresh company prefers 60F for 7 days as they see other ripening issues with the increased respiration rate at 70F.
* DPA helps a lot with desensitizing but regulation-wise there are many that prefer not to use it especially if there is time for the proper holding period.
