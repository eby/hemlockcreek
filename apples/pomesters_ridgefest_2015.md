# Pomesters Ridgefest 2015

### Youngquist Orchards
* Lost production due to shear wind
* lost 30-70% depending on block
* Damaged orchards should be torn out and get better density
* 10-11 ft spacing. No wider than 12
* honey crisp works well with fruiting wall. Good color
* sand helps with color. Only push N at young stage. Watch for fire blight with pushing though
* N - 2oz per year of age was old way. 20-30 N/acre. 30/acre. 50-75 next couple. 100-150 to 4th. Then back off. 30 week span for clay. 
* summer naa for return bloom. June till July 15
* thinning later and leave doubles out west to reduce vigor and reduce bitter pit. Worries about return bloom. Balancing act. Terminals draw calcium away from fruit. 
* larger fruit more prone to bitter pit so leave smaller. Higher crop load is less than others but less return bloom. 
* second leaf cut back all feathers to 3in length. Leader goes well and gets better caliper. Get lots of new feathers that can select for flatness. Doesn't have to tie down. Bud9. Nic29 even better for system. 
* 150 calcium nitrate total split every couple weeks on the bud9 for first few years
* no fruit first two. Third just enough to keep branches down. 50-75 lb/acre plus urea in spring
* phosphorus is major player in health. Color. Etc. 16-20 in fruit analysis. Too little also bitter pit. 
* too high magnesium and can make loam act like clay. Example in handout would recommend gypsum in spring
* k/mg ration important in addition to pH
* once mg hits certain point the plant blocks it. Tests may say mg deficiency but just need to bring soil down
* P is same
* do preplant stuff and get everything at right spot 
* foliage feeding is usually not worth it. A few do. Tissue test will look bad when things good. If plant is working hard it will look bad. Some foliar sticks in leaf and will show up on tests but do nothing. Need to know what you need and what to expect change wise. 
* gypsum under trip line in spring can be as good as five sprays
* post harvest gypsum also good
* just prior to golf ball. Throughout season. Low zinc and calcium doesn't distribute. cell division time before bulking. Other time is 3-4 weeks before harvest for calcium mobility. 
* 2g/gal for straight calcium chloride but find formulated on with built in buffers. Don't roll your own. 
* phosphate works well in fertigation vs ground. 
* calcium does well helping with heat
* gypsum for calcium need to make sure don't mess up mg
* brassicas kill microrhysi

### Ridgeview Orchards
* 50% packout due to bitter pit
* girdle 118 and root trim to increase fruit
* root near bloom. 3x trunk width. 12in here. Shooting for 60% gone
* others saw no improvement after two years. Reduce fruit size but not much bitter pit reduction
* depends on soil. Some too deep. Some every other year. Some hitting with chainsaw a bit into. During bloom. Both sides about 2 inches apart vertical. Guiatine cut 
* stress means bitter pit.
* point of something. Is humidity and rehydration of foliar sprays. Should be on MdS
* calcium nitrate is usually overkill and too much N when being high right
* post harvest helps with decay and fungal. Can help firm up. But can leave salty taste if near 2%
* apogee helps slow calcium sink by terminus. Can be better or same as calcium spray
* too much calcium can throw mg and K uptake to change and can affect storage and taste in general
* starch clearing of entire surface for maturity. 1ppm ethylene starts ripening. Goes on and off during season. 
* 38F is cold injury threshold for storing. 
* holding fruit around 50ish to avoid chilling injury
* 3% co2 is toxic to honeycrisp
* 20C helped with ca injury. 68-70F for 2 days desensitized almost completely to ca injury. 
* diphetalamine worked effectively. 
* starch test is great. Shows before ethylene. Ba meter is shit at moment. 
* smart fresh people like 60F for 7 days. Doesn't like 70 for respiration rate.

### Joe Rasch Orchards
* Order root stock at least a few years out
* Certain varieties that are popular also need lead time
