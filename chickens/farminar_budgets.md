## Coyote Run Farm
* start with just what you need. scale to market
* growing own feed was prohibitive unless you have equipment. buy bulk
* use hot water in black buckets vs heating. more labor but more mobile
* throw hay down on snow to get them outside. don’t mind cold just snow
* was cheaper to find place to store used cartons vs buying new
* mobile electric net fencing. move around.
* wash with non-antibacterial soap water
* white clover and grasses
* for spent chickens, host butchering party and use as food. isn’t enough profit to be worth selling. publicity is better
* has had to raise cost multiple times due to feed
* did all eggs. meat not profitable
* gold star and red star. prefer gold star birds
* eggs bring in customers for veggies. 1.8 acres of veggies for about ~20k. 3k heirloom plants
* replace hens every 18 months. layer breed so not the seasonal molting issue that some older heritage breeds have
* food from local coop. oats and some vegetable scraps. non-poultry meat scraps
* untreated wood chips for horses in boxes. cleaner
* compost goes to garden/pastures
* keep weeds and cover low so hens use laying boxes
* welp hatcheries
* don’t hatch out. getting straight run was cheaper than dealing with roosters
* water pans. open. topped off multiple times a day. winter w/ hot water
